# A data-driven method for identifying shorter symptom criteria sets: the case for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder.

This is a code repository for ["A data-driven method for identifying shorter symptom criteria sets: the case for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder."](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291718001551) by Raffo CD, Hasin DS, Appelbaum P, & Wall MM published in *Psychological Medicine*, June 2018. (https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291718001551)


The SAS code is explained in detail in the `SAS_macro_readme.docx` file. The two SAS macros included in the `CODE` folder are:

(1)  `DSF_v2.sas`
- This macro runs through each step as described in the article and provides a final dataset with the optimal diagnostic short-forms for the specified data set.

(2)  `DSFTF_v2.sas`
- This macro uses the datasets created in the previous macro to output tables and figures used to investigate findings
